# FibonacciExamples
Series of C++ Fibonacci examples under various conditionals.

Suppose you have a function, myfib, declared as follows:
int myfib(const int n), which returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Using this function:

(FibA) Write a function, myfibseries, that also takes a single parameter, n, and prints out
the entire sequence of Fibonacci numbers up to and including n, with a comma
between each (do NOT use loops).

(FibB) Write a function, myfibseriesR, that also takes a single parameter, n, and prints out
the entire sequence of Fibonacci numbers up to and including n, with a comma
between each, but in REVERSE order (do NOT use loops).

(FibC) Write a function, myfibsum, that takes a single parameter, n, and prints out the
sum of all the Fibonacci numbers up to and including n (do NOT use loops).
